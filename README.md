# Student Habits vs Academic Performance

- This project explores how student behaviors, such as: study time, internet usage, and daily habits; correlate with academic performance. The goal was to uncover meaningful insights through structured SQL queries and interactive Tableau dashboards.

##  Key Features
- Performed SQL-based analysis to extract patterns from student behavior data
- Explored relationships between study habits, social factors, and academic grades
- Built interactive dashboards using Tableau Public to present key findings

##  Tools Used
- Jupyter Notebook (`SQL Prac.ipynb`) for SQL query practice and preliminary analysis
- Tableau Public for data visualization
- SQLite for query execution
- GitHub for project versioning and sharing

##  Files Included
- `SQL Prac.ipynb`: Notebook with all SQL queries and commentary
- `student_habits_performance.csv`: Dataset used for analysis
- `top_scorers.xlsx`: Filtered data from original dataset

##  Summary
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to drive insightful analysis, and how Tableau can communicate those insights through clear and interactive visuals. Its a part of my data analytics portfolio to showcase end-to-end analytical thinking and visualization skills.

##  About Me
